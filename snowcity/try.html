                                <p>A great price online on my 2019 Kawasaki Concours led me to Snow City. My first
                                    contact with Snow City was with Norm. Throughout the sales process, he was a
                                    gentleman and a scholar. Norm is the kind of salesperson that everyone in sales
                                    should strive to be -- customer-focused, and not a hard-sell. The sales process was
                                    transparent and enjoyable... it was really a nice conversation. Despite the
                                    challenges of Covid19, Norm followed up with a solid tutorial for the bike's
                                    features upon delivery (as well as a review for things I forgot when I brought it in
                                    for its 1000 km service).The great thing that I have seen about Snow City is that
                                    all departments work well, and in concert. Carrie in the service department made my
                                    1000 km appointment a smooth process, and was flexible when I had to reschedule.
                                    Even though her bike detailer was away for the day, she still did her best to buff
                                    up my bike and get some bug corpses off of it!Again, this is what I mean about a
                                    successful organization working in concert. I wanted some extra 'K Pass'
                                    programmable key fobs, so I emailed Norm. He passed the request on to Andy in
                                    accessories, and then to Carrie, since one of her technicians would have program
                                    those key fobs. Brilliant communication! Andy has also been very helpful in finding
                                    me a helmet visor I had given up on finding online.Snow City Cycle and Marine is an
                                    outstanding motorcycle dealership. Keep up the great work!<br><br></p>

                                <p>Bought my very first Motorcycle from Sean the salesman. I put down deposit for the
                                    Honda CBR500R the second day after visiting the store. Our interaction began with a
                                    very concise and truthful conversation between me and Sean. He basically asked me
                                    what my needs were and what I was looking for. Knowing I was buying my first
                                    motorcycle with very limited knowledge on sports bikes in general, he recommended
                                    what he thought was a good fit for me and the bike. Today, I think his judgment is
                                    still quite accurate. We went directly to the bike he suggested and we had another
                                    brief conversation about the specific bike. Also, I asked some general questions
                                    about insurance and performance...etc. The interaction as a whole was very short and
                                    concise. I felt that he was quite professional. With good knowledge of the industry
                                    in general and genuinely cared about my needs instead of trying to push the old
                                    inventory out the door.After I decided on the bike, I asked him many more questions
                                    and he was always there to answer them. I am quite happy with what I received. Both
                                    the CBR 500R and the service. I look forward to any future dealings we have.</p>

                                <p>Have dealt with Susan Trombley in "ordering". She has gone above board to help me
                                    find the right parts for my bike of which I was having difficulty finding. She not
                                    only found what I was looking for, but supplied me with additional information which
                                    led me to purchasing via your company. She took the time to ensure that what she
                                    found was what I wanted/needed and sent me info to ensure that this was what I
                                    desired. From a customer standpoint, she went above and beyond to see that the

                                    the showroom, all staff exemplified my experience. Went above and beyond to ensure
                                    on time delivery of my motorcycle. I truly appreciated the no nonsense direct
                                    pricing with upfront available discounts. Highly recommend SNow City for all of your

                                    bike. Out of all the sales reps I had bike conversations with at the Show (at least
                                    8-9), he was by far the most knowledgeable as well as the most authentic and
                                    relaxed. He was not making a "pitch" to sell me a bike. Sean also had a line up of
                                    more senior riders/customers waiting to speak with him at the Show but respectfully
                                    declined to speak with them until all of my "newbie" questions were entirely
                                    answered. He immediately caught my attention more than anyone who has tried to sell
                                    me anything! Subsequently, after doing a great deal more homework, I narrowed my
                                    choice down to three different bikes. I next went to see Sean at Snow City where he
                                    spent a great deal more time explaining the pros/cons of each of my 3 options (one
                                    of which was a bike they don't even sell!). He was observant, thorough and
                                    responsive. He went well beyond answering questions at the level I asked them. He
                                    seemed to understand my need for more information and so gave me more information
                                    even if it was after work hours. With that level of commitment and service, there is
                                    only one place I would buy my first bike and from only one sales rep. I bought my
                                    first bike from Sean Hearty at Snow City. I am now the very proud owner of a
                                    Kawasaki Ninja. However, something more needs to be said. I had some very
                                    complicated reasons for not being able to pick up my bike right away. Sean assisted
                                    me with my problem as did others at Snow City. Remember, my bike had been sold so it
                                    was just taking up space at Snow City. The manager Mike Ball as well as the Service
                                    Department could have all put pressure on me to take my bike so they could bring in
                                    another bike to sell. Yet, I was made to feel comfortable about my situation. They
                                    understood and made things as easy as they could for me. I cannot say enough good
                                    things about this place. I have already starting spreading the word to others who
                                    deal with bikes (insurance companies, bike training courses). Thank you Sean Hearty
                                    and everyone who assisted me at Snow City!! I will be back again soon. I am sure of
                                    it.</p>

                                <p>I was on the hunt for a Seadoo Spark, I called Snow City Scarborough and the service
                                    was absolutely amazing!<br><br>I dealt with Sean Harty and every question or concern
                                    was answered or dealt with. It was the most easy purchase because of how well every
                                    detail about the machine itself and the billing was explained.<br><br>I was also
                                    inquiring about a life jacket and the staff there was also very helpful too, letting
                                    me try on and see a bunch of different vests and giving me info on the best suited
                                    for me. <br><br>If ever in the market for any other watercraft or street bike I know
                                    where I will be going, 100% Thank you to Sean and everyone at Snow city, you guys

                                <p>Such a great experience at Snow City. I started riding in 1979 on a '77 RD400 and
                                    have had many fixer-uppers since then. My first new bike was an 1989 Ninja 750 (my
                                    wife bought it for me). What a blast. Fast forward to 2017 I'm 53 and I just
                                    purchased my second and last new bike (cause my wife said so) from Mike and Sean, a
                                    2016 Yamaha V Star 1300 Deluxe. Great guys to deal with and a great bike too. I'm so
                                    happy to have bought it from Snow City. Hans would always have a friendly greeting
                                    as I walked to the parts counter with my wife in tow to see Roger when I was
                                    rebuilding my '84 KZ750. Roger was so instrumental in my rebuild he knew how to find
                                    the parts I needed. After purchasing the V Star it remained on the dealership floor
                                    for a while in front of the Service Counter. I'd go in with my wife for my weekly
                                    "visit", remove the Sold Sign and sit on it. The Service Counter staff would
                                    eye-ball me and say "you're the only one allowed to do that" Hahaha.<br><br>I look
                                    forward to a long future with Snow City for all my (and my wife's) motorcycle needs,
                                    you should too.<br><br>- Clifford</p>

                                <p>Hi, my name is Trevor and I have been a long time customer at your parts department.
                                    I just wanted to quickly commend Roger at the parts desk for a job well done. I had
                                    a "mystery brake lever" on my KX250 that the master cylinder had been swapped out
                                    and I had no idea what model of bike it was actually off of. Roger took the time to
                                    check what Kawasaki levers he had in stock, found the correct one (needle in a hay
                                    stack!), and even checked to find out what the master cylinder had been swapped
                                    from. Turns out my dirtbike had the master cylinder off an ATV. He was a lifesaver
                                    and went above and beyond the normal call of duty on this one. I very much
                                    appreciated his help and just wanted to let you know how much of a asset he is to
                                    the parts department and to your company. I have always been happy when I leave, and
                                    today was no exception. He definitely deserves a pat on the back. The service is
                                    always great from everyone, but today was exceptional. Thanks very much and I will
                                    be in any time I need parts.<br><br>Cheers. -Trevor</p>

                                    know just how much a customer like myself is thankfull for the service you provide.
                                    I purchased my 2012 Kawasaki Voyager from your dealership last spring from Hans
                                    would was excellent to deal with and since the day I had my first service I have
                                    dealt with Scott Szollos in service. I want you to know that it is people like him
                                    that will keep people like me coming back to Snowcity. As you can see by the email
                                    thread below Scott has replied to all of my questions (regardless of the time it was
                                    sent). Scott has provide the knowledge, support, advise and service and he is to be

                                    miles around. <br><br>As you can see from below I have recently taken my bike into a
                                    local dealership in Guelph to have a front end wobble issue corrected and after a
                                    week the issue is not fixed and the service staff dont seem to really be concerned.
                                    This type of service is why I traveled from Guelph to Toronto to purchase my bike
                                    and have traveled there for my service with Scott. I am kicking myself for not
                                    taking it there this time. Not will likely not return to them again.<br><br>As I
                                    have already stated, Scott and your service team are second to none......please keep
                                    up the good work.<br><br>Thanks again from a very satisfied customer with the total
                                    sales and service I have received from your dealership. I wish all dealerships were
                                    like yours.</p>

                                <p>Snow City is one of the best motorcycle shops I have used over the years. They are
                                    always very helpful and friendly. Because of the great service they have I recommend
                                    them to others. I have purchased two bikes from them and motorcycle gear as well.
                                    Hopefully will get a 3rd bike there down the road.</p>

                                    care of me. I tell everyone I know to go to Snow City Cycle Marine and buy from Andy
                                    and have the service and parts depts take care of them. They truely are a five star

                                <p>I thought I should send you an unsolicited note on the purchase of my new 2009 Yamaha
                                    V-Star 950 which was purchased from your store on Monday March 25th. I originally
                                    had intentions of buying a Suzuki Boulevard C50T from another dealer but when I came
                                    into your store on the 25th of March, the V-Star caught my eye right away and I
                                    cancelled the order with the other dealer right away. Most importantly, being a new
                                    bike owner, I felt totally confident when I made the purchase that is was the right
                                    bike for me, and I must say that this was ONLY possible by the extreme
                                    professionalism and genuine integrity of your Sales staff, primarily Rocky Aguanno.
                                    What a great guy! Dealing with Rocky just made me feel that I was doing the right
                                    thing without a doubt and Im a picky guy! The way that he looked after the deal from
                                    start to finish answering all my questions and concerns was without a doubt, the
                                    most pleasant buying experience I have ever had. The Sales Manager, Mike Ball was
                                    also extremely helpful and he worked hand in hand with Rocky to solidify the deal.
                                    Today I went on my first long ride with the bike and it performed flawlessly and I
                                    am so happy that Rocky convinced me into buying this bike. He said that he was
                                    confident that I would like the bike and boy was he right. I cant thank him enough.
                                    Please extend my gratitude to Rocky and Mike for me, you have some great people
                                    working for you. I am also spreading the word with my friends on Snow City. I wish
                                    you all the success in the world. Keep on being a great store!</p>

                                <p>My name is Linda but to Hans Im also known as Tweet. Im not sure if you remember this
                                    but we met briefly when I visited Hans at the Toronto Auto Show during my break. I
                                    was working at the Mercedes-Benz smart booth. Its okay if you dont remember, I know
                                    youre a busy man. I just wanted to let you know how happy I am with my new 2010
                                    Kawasaki Ninja 250R and the exceptional service I received from your staff.
                                    Unfortunately, I didnt get a chance to meet all of them but I hear theyre all
                                    wonderful. My friend, Mike Fan; whom recently just purchased his bike from Snow City
                                    says nothing but good things. I believe that 100%. Hans, the sales consultant that
                                    assisted me with my first vehicle purchase (Im still stunned I purchased a
                                    motorcycle before a car) was nothing but fun, positive, and very entertaining! He
                                    was very consistent with his attitude even though I gave him a hard time: (I asked
                                    him to show me the storage space for the 250R even though I knew it was a ridiculous
                                    request. Its just.I was curious. Can you blame a girl?) Unlike most sales
                                    consultants Ive dealt with and have encountered, Hans was the kind I like. Very laid
                                    back, not intimidating, friendly, and approachable and got right to the point. Apart
                                    from that, I also purchased my first helmet as well from your store and thats all
                                    thanks to Sandy! She was very helpful, friendly, informative, and most of all
                                    patient. I know this because I took up a lot of her time. It took me about 2 visits
                                    to find a helmet I liked. I just cant say thank you enough and how happy I am with
                                    your establishment. Not only do you sell great products but you also have a
                                    fantastic team with great customer service. A lot of stores are lacking that
                                    nowadays, Im sure a lot of people notice. But I know theres nothing but success in
                                    the present and future for Snow City.</p>

                                    Scott and the crew last evening for a terrific seminar. The "beginners crash course
                                    on motorcycle maintenance" session was very informative yet casual and at a level
                                    for beginners to understand. No, I'm not ready to do my own servicing, but I have a
                                    much better understanding of my motorcycle, how it works, how it wears and some
                                    basic things to look out for. The session was also a great confidence booster in
                                    your services! Thanks again for this opportunity and thank you very much for
                                    allowing my bike to be used as the demo! "</p>

                                <p>"Thankyou for giving us customers the chance to drive a crazy three wheel vehicle .
                                    It was a lot of fun . I can see why people are buying them . It is like being able
                                    to drive a skidoo in the summer on the highways and byways . The t-shirt fits great
                                    and the boss at the BBQ did an awesome job with the sausages and hamburgers . Thanks
                                    again for a great afternoon . I may also drop by today as I own a 1975 Kawasaki H1-F
                                    and it is Kawasaki Day today ,WooHoo !!! "</p>

                                <p>"Thank-you Scott and Fiona. My CanAm Spyder was towed in on Thursday because it
                                    wouldn't start. They were able to find the problem late Friday afternoon. The
                                    problem was caused by HID headlights I installed. They got me back on the road by
                                    Monday. Great fast service considering how busy they are at this time of the year.
                                    Had the extended BEST Warranty and the tow to the dealership was prompt and free. "

                                <p>"Hey Hans, Got your phone message but I have been a little busy with the snow. About
                                    the bike, i got 8 hours on it Monday into Tuesday and it totally exceeded my
                                    expectations. The diff lock is a game changer. The only challenge was the idling.
                                    Seems when the handle bars are turned to the right the idle goes up . I couldn't
                                    adjust much lower. It seems to be the cable needs to get worked in. By the time I
                                    left it was barely noticeable. I think it probably is part of the break in and I
                                    will check it out after 20 hours or so. Otherwise the bike is exactly what I was
                                    looking for. I am going back up Sunday and will most likely put another 8-10 hours
                                    on it ,so I will update you later. I enjoyed the whole purchase experience with you
                                    and SCC The kids loved the t-shirts. It is nice when you can spend some money and
                                    feel like you really got some value. That does happen very often anymore. So thanks
                                    for everything and have a Happy New Year !! "</p>

                                <p>"Mike Ball was terrific when I bought my bike and always chats when I drop by. I feel
                                    I got a great deal on a great bike. The only reason I rated service a 4 is because I
                                    had a couple of minor problems but they were dealt with quickly and to my
                                    satisfaction. One suggestion I can make would be to offer a pick -up and delivery
                                    service when having the bike in for service. I'd happily pay for that. And perhaps
                                    more special events to draw customers into the "Snow City family." Make being a SC
                                    customer a special experience. Or if you do have special events, you need to market
                                    them more! If you hosted a bike night BBQ or something it would get riders in there
                                    when they wouldn't otherwise be coming in. Or how about a seminar on winter prep?
                                    You've got great people and products and good service, but I think you could work on
                                    your "presence" a bit. Might be time to refresh the website a bit too. Have a look
                                    at what GP does. Then there's the issue of SON practically giving Suzuki's away, but
                                    I don't know what you can do about that! You certainly beat them on the purchase and
                                    service experiences, but it's such a huge price difference, that's a tough one. I'd
                                    happily pay and extra $100-200 to deal with you guys, but $1200 saving on a new bike
                                    is hard to resist. Anyway, I like what I've read about the new V-Strom, so I'll see
                                    you in the spring!"</p>

                                    received from you over the past few years. Especially to Andy for all his sales
                                    help, and to Sandy for all the times she went out of her to way to help me find
                                    special parts. Cassandra was always efficient at the service desk, and the service
                                    work was always well done. I have just traded my Kawasaki in for a Honda Goldwing,
                                    so will not be a regular customer of yours anymore for the foreseeable future -
                                    however I will still pop in to say hello if I am in the neighbourhood, and recommend
                                    your dealership to anybody I know that is looking for products that you sell! Thanks

                                    she is finally warming up to the fact that we made the right decision. Ha! She now
                                    calls it her bike. You went beyond the call of duty by coming in on your day off to
                                    help deliver the product and I am grateful for that. It made the process seamless
                                    and rewarding. I just wanted to say thank you again and I will definitely be
                                    recommending Snow City to all of my acquaintances especially you Rocky. Again thanks

                                    purchased the machine new at Snow City, it was nice to see Mike from Sales. It seems

                                    that my original drive belt was not return, leaving me with no spare belt. I will be
                                    returning to the dealership on Tuesday, Feb 22 for my belt or a replacement."</p>

                                <p>"I recently purchased 2, 2011 ski-doo Grand touring ski-doo's from Andy Federchuk. I
                                    found him to be extreemly knowledgeable and trust worthy. He made me feel
                                    comfortable with his non-aggresive sales style. I was most pleased with his concern
                                    about our family choosing the right machines for us. We have been out three times
                                    this winter and are so happy with the machines Andy helped us choose. Andy....job

                                    motorcycle rides like a dream. I had many compliments from people at stop lights on
                                    the way home. They said the bike was a real beauty. Thank you for the assistance you
                                    provided in buying the bike. I couldn't have asked for a better salesman. You did a
                                    top notch job in salesmanship and during delivery it seemed so effortless. Michael

                                    situation sorted out on Friday. I've put 70kms on the motorcycle already and I'm
                                    absolutely pleased with a number of things, my decision to ride, my decision to
                                    purchase the FZ6, and my decision to work with you/Snow City. I appreciate both your
                                    professionalism and attention to detail. Like my cousin Walter, if I ever have an
                                    opportunity to recommend you to a new customer, I will do so without hesitation!

                                    In the past 6 months I have spent thousands on repairs and up-grades to my bike and
                                    my girlfriend. Your service is outstanding. The owner came up to York Region during
                                    rush-hour taffic to pick up Patrizia and her bike! My tech. walked my bike out and
                                    explained all he had done to repair it and I was impressed how he went into great
                                    detail about small things that could lead to much bigger things. It's my opinion
                                    that Snow City is the best in the industry on all counts! I couldn't be happier
                                    spending my heard earned money here! Thanks Again."</p>

                                    experience I would buy from Rocky again. He is a valuable salesperson for your
                                    dealership. I have ordered parts from the service desk and found these folks to be
                                    knowledgeable and personable. The real test for any dealership comes a year or two
                                    later when I need to order parts or have service on my purchase. Then my comments
                                    become more relevant about the dealership. Hopefully, I can still rank everything
                                    with 5 stars."</p>

                                    Sea-Doo Challenger 180 in early summer with a trade in of a 04 sportster. Everything
                                    went smooth, only had a short time to do the purchase, but Mike Made it happen.
                                    Enjoyed the boat all summer really good product.The over all service from the Gang
                                    at Snow city was Awesome. Hope to see you on the water. Thanks again Kev &amp;

                                <p>"I would just like to let you guys know how pleased I am with the service I received
                                    after my bike dropped a valve and destroyed the engine. Scott (sorry, I don't know
                                    his last name) sourced a used engine (in Kitchener?), drove out to pick it up
                                    (special thanks to whoever had to put up with motor oil in the truck bed), and
                                    swapped the engines in record time. Beside the fact that Snow City is not even a
                                    Kawasaki dealer, Scott (and the whole team at Snow City) displayed excellent
                                    commitment to service and desire to help the customer. Many thanks, and I will
                                    definitely bring my business back in the future. "</p>

                                <p>"Dear Snow City Cycle, I am very happy with the new Scorpion helmet and jacket I
                                    purchased a week and a half ago at your store. Being a new rider, I knew very little
                                    about what products I needed. I would like to say that Britney who helped me with my
                                    purchases was one of the most helpful and knowledgeable salespeople I have had the
                                    pleasure of dealing with. She took the time to explain the different styles and
                                    manufacturers and was very patient and attentive as I tried and re-tried on 4
                                    different jackets and at least half a dozen helmets. It is a rare experience these
                                    days to find this kind of courteous and professional service. Thank you Britney and
                                    Snow City Cycle, Sincerely, Jim C."</p>

                                <p>"Bought bike at Motorcycle show 12/07 from Hans Van De Moesdyk and was very pleased
                                    with his professionalism. Upon pickup of bike, Hans was unable to be there due to
                                    commitment to attend bike show on the same weekend. Had another sales rep help me
                                    when I picked up the bike. Knew his bikes but didn't seem too concerned when I
                                    pointed out a couple of scratches. I had him sign on my copy of sales receipt to
                                    bring in for 1000 kms service."</p>

                                <p>"I Just wanted to say thank you to Andy and Scotty with this testimonial. At the end
                                    of a full day at the 2008 Toronto Bike Show, Snowcity was the last dealer we
                                    visited. I'm sure everyone was tired from a very long and busy day of being on their
                                    feet! I know we were. However, it was a real pleasure to talk with both Andy and
                                    Scotty about the various bikes we were interested in. Andy was in sales but was so
                                    relaxed it really put us at easy in making such a big decision. Scotty was an
                                    experienced technician and his experience on bikes and in the shop really helped us
                                    pick the right bike. At the end of the day, Andy and Scotty really helped us make
                                    our decision and we could not be happier! So which bike did we end up buying you
                                    ask?... My dad is now a proud owner of a brand new Honda ST1300A! Thanks guys! Kind

                                <p>"I had a recurring service issue with my bike that the manufacturer had promised to
                                    cover if it reoccurred. When it did, and not that long after, they backed out after
                                    a lot of verbal run around. Fiona and Scottie hounded them on my behalf for over 6
                                    months before they backed down and offered a compromise solution. Thanks to Fiona
                                    and Scott, I eventually had a repaired bike and somehow they'd arranged for full
                                    warranty coverage of the repair with no cost to me. The service department alone
                                    would keep me going back but help that Roger and Sandy provide in Parts are an
                                    additional incentive. The friendly staff and the support provided by Snow City
                                    Service and Parts make it worth driving into Toronto. Thanks again to Fiona and

                                <p>"Hi, When I bought my almost new Yamaha FZ1 motorcycle I checked Yamaha's web site
                                    for service dealers and SCCM is the only 5 star in the Toronto area so I had to
                                    check them out. I was delightlyfully surprised to receive friendly one on one
                                    service and enough cannot be said about Roger in 'Parts'. He is always willing to
                                    help find whatever you looking for, gets back to you in a timely manner and even
                                    assited with scheduling my service - which brings me to Scott; also very friendly
                                    and conscienous about his work so much so you have to believe him when he says he
                                    enjoys working on my ride. Anyways, if you're looking for a reputable, friendly and
                                    service oriented dealer then look no more!</p>

                                    that I wish I had known about Snow City years ago. People say its worth the drive to
                                    Acton, well its definately worth the drive to Scarborough. Your turnaround time with
                                    regards to servicing our new bike is astounding compared to the service we have been
                                    given in the past. I can't thank you enough Alan Potter Bowmanville"</p>

                                    all of our purchases. Our son thinks highly of Hans because he makes him feel

                                <p>"Once again, I must commend Scott on the excellent work he performed on my 97 Valk
                                    over the winter. The bike, with many modifications, including a super-charger, has
                                    never run better than it does now. In almost 40 years of riding, I have never
                                    encountered a better mechanic when it comes to quickly diagnosing problems and
                                    making sure you are 100% satisfied before you ride off the lot. More importantly, I
                                    trust Scott to always treat me fairly and it is obvious that he is always focussed
                                    upon providing great customer service as opposed to just completing a job. Heck, I
                                    have had mechanic's refuse to work on my bike or want to charge me more because of
                                    all the custom modifications, but Scott clearly enjoys and takes pride in working on
                                    my bike and getting things right. Scott reflects my overall experience with everyone
                                    at Snow City...great customer service delivered with skill and knowledge in the most
                                    friendly and customer focussed manner possible. Thanks Scott for getting my bike
                                    back to where it "blows my socks off" again and for taking such good care of it this
                                    winter. When I do buy my next bike (of course it would be a "second bike") Snow City
                                    is without a doubt where I would spend my money."</p>

                                <p>"Dear George &amp; Vera, I thought I would have a chance to do this in person, but,
                                    it turns out I wont be in TO to see you before too much time has passed. So forgive
                                    the email, but I wanted to thank both of you for the wonderful opportunity that you
                                    provided to go to San Diego. In a word, well three words; it was great!. George was
                                    a wonderful and gracious host, and it was a pleasure to have spent time with him.
                                    Meeting Chris was a bonus, and I thank you for the opportunity this afforded me to
                                    meet him. Bombardier really pulled out the stops and provided a fantastic weekend of
                                    fun and training. Every aspect of the venue was first class! However, to be honest,
                                    I went down a little sceptical once I found out it was going to be a 3-wheeled
                                    motorcycle (remember the 3-wheeled Peugeot?). But I have to hand it to the ingenuity
                                    of this organization, it really was a fantastic eye-opener and a machine that I
                                    became very interested in. I think it is right on the money for what I want in a
                                    long-distance cruiser. So again, thank you and the staff of Snow City for your
                                    kindness to me, and to BRP for the wonderful idea they allowed me to share in its
                                    launch. Kindest regards Dr J. Cosgrove ND, MSc President, NaturPharm "</p>

                                    in 1984 and the service then was fantastic. My friend Fred that was with me couldn't
                                    believe your caring attitude. You guys are great. I would HIGHLY recommend you any

                                    with ALL my questions without ANY attitude. These two qualities are the very reasons
                                    why I would bring my bike back to Snow City to take care of all my bike's needs.
                                    Anyway, that's all folks!!! And to Roy, just wanted to send out some props and

                                <p>"As I'm sure you know, I have been doing business with Snow City now for more than 15
                                    years. Throughout this entire time period you and your team have always provided me
                                    with competitive prices and unparalleled service. Snow City has always been
                                    responsive to my needs and have routinely "gone the extra mile" for me when I've
                                    asked (and more importantly when I haven't asked!). I too run a business here in the
                                    Toronto area, and accordingly I am particularly sensitive to the level of customer
                                    service which I receive as a consumer. I also, over the years, have purchased a
                                    significant number of "toys" (ie. Motorcycles, snowmobiles, jet skis, boats, etc.)
                                    and therefore have a very good benchmark for the calibre of dealers of such
                                    products. The fact that I keep going back to Snow City time and time again for my
                                    purchases is the best indication of my own opinion of you as a dealer. Snow City is,
                                    simply put, the best dealer I've ever dealt with! Keep up the great work."</p>

                                    machines for the upcoming season and past seasons we are able to ride trouble free
                                    for most of the season. Minor regular season service should be maintained by the

                                <p>"I've been a Snow City Cycle customer for the past two years and along the way, we've
                                    developed a great relationship. I am what you might call a "picky" customer and
                                    George and the crew have always gone that extra mile to see that my needs have been
                                    met whether pertaining to a new purchase, service or parts. Spending money can
                                    sometimes be more difficult than earning it, but with the trust that I have built
                                    with these folks I know I am getting the value for my dollar that my hard work
                                    deserves. Every time I visit the store I am greeted with a smile, by a crew that you
                                    can tell loves their work. I myself work in the retail service industry and know
                                    what customer service is all about and so do they. If you are in the market fir any
                                    type of recreational vehicle, or service on a vehicle you own, there is no better
                                    place in the GTA to go than Snow City Cycle."</p>

                                <p>"Thank you very much for sponsoring a hole at Lion Head Golf and Country Club during
                                    our Lastman Invitational Golf Tournament '96 on September 3rd. The event raised more
                                    than $55,000 for Bloorview MacMillan Children's Hospital. This was our biggest, best
                                    and most successful tournament to date. It couldn't have happened without the
                                    support of people like you. Your hole sponsorship added a special lustre to our
                                    effort and was noticed by each of our 308 participating golfers. It was really super
                                    of you to be involved. Perhaps the greatest reward comes in knowing that we have
                                    assisted, in a most meaningful way, children with physical disabilities and chronic
                                    health problems.I am proud of what our community has achieved in this regard. Thanks
                                    again for being part of it. You're great!"</p>

                                <p>"I'm writing to thank you for the great service that was performed on my motorcycle
                                    by your mechanic Scott. I purchased a relatively obscure used bike this year which
                                    needed some work, and although initially hesitent about finding a reputable dealer
                                    to service it, the work your shop has performed has thoroughly impressed me. I was
                                    afraid that I might receive poor service because I neither purchased the bike from
                                    you, nor was it a new and fancy machine, but all your staff treated me exceptionally
                                    well, and serviced my bike with great care and efficiency. When I came to pick up my
                                    bike on a Saturday morning, despite the fact that it was busy in the shop, Scott
                                    took the time to answer all my questions thoroughly and even washed my bike for me
                                    so it looked spotless when I rode off. In a day and age when people have come
                                    accustomed to receiving poor service as the status quo, I found it refreshing to be
                                    treated as a person. I will definitely recommend your shop to others and you have
                                    created a loyal customer out of me. "<br><br></p>

                                <p>"I purchased my new Honda VFR from your fine establishment this year and my
                                    experience simply could not have been improved upon. Not only have you earned my
                                    business for life but I actually now find myself going out of my way to explain to
                                    others that they need not go anywhere but Snow City, for all their power product
                                    needs.You have a fine bunch there George. Not only was price, service and customer
                                    focus exemplary, but for the first time in years I felt as though my satisfaction
                                    was more important to someone than my money. Your genuine attitudes towards your
                                    customers will always keep them coming back. Frankly I would not care to spend my
                                    hard-earned money anywhere else, and I really did shop around extensively before
                                    lucking out with you people.A 10 out of 10 it is, and I don't recall ever dishing
                                    out one ot these before to anyone but my wife. After all, she let me have the
                                    bike.My best wishes for your continued success."</p>

                                <p>"Just wanted to drop a quick line to give you all a big thank you, especially to
                                    Scott and the crew last evening for a terrific seminar. The "beginners crash course
                                    on motorcycle maintenance" session was very informative yet casual and at a level
                                    for beginners to understand. No, I'm not ready to do my own servicing, but I have a
                                    much better understanding of my motorcycle, how it works, how it wears and some
                                    basic things to look out for. The session was also a great confidence booster in
                                    your services! Thanks again for this opportunity and thank you very much for
                                    allowing my bike to be used as the demo! "</p>

                                <p>My name is Linda but to Hans Im also known as Tweet. Im not sure if you remember this
                                    but we met briefly when I visited Hans at the Toronto Auto Show during my break. I
                                    was working at the Mercedes-Benz smart booth. Its okay if you dont remember, I know
                                    youre a busy man. I just wanted to let you know how happy I am with my new 2010
                                    Kawasaki Ninja 250R and the exceptional service I received from your staff.
                                    Unfortunately, I didnt get a chance to meet all of them but I hear theyre all
                                    wonderful. My friend, Mike Fan; whom recently just purchased his bike from Snow City
                                    says nothing but good things. I believe that 100%. Hans, the sales consultant that
                                    assisted me with my first vehicle purchase (Im still stunned I purchased a
                                    motorcycle before a car) was nothing but fun, positive, and very entertaining! He
                                    was very consistent with his attitude even though I gave him a hard time: (I asked
                                    him to show me the storage space for the 250R even though I knew it was a ridiculous
                                    request. Its just.I was curious. Can you blame a girl?) Unlike most sales
                                    consultants Ive dealt with and have encountered, Hans was the kind I like. Very laid
                                    back, not intimidating, friendly, and approachable and got right to the point. Apart
                                    from that, I also purchased my first helmet as well from your store and thats all
                                    thanks to Sandy! She was very helpful, friendly, informative, and most of all
                                    patient. I know this because I took up a lot of her time. It took me about 2 visits
                                    to find a helmet I liked. I just cant say thank you enough and how happy I am with
                                    your establishment. Not only do you sell great products but you also have a
                                    fantastic team with great customer service. A lot of stores are lacking that
                                    nowadays, Im sure a lot of people notice. But I know theres nothing but success in
                                    the present and future for Snow City.</p>

                                <p>I thought I should send you an unsolicited note on the purchase of my new 2009 Yamaha
                                    V-Star 950 which was purchased from your store on Monday March 25th. I originally
                                    had intentions of buying a Suzuki Boulevard C50T from another dealer but when I came
                                    into your store on the 25th of March, the V-Star caught my eye right away and I
                                    cancelled the order with the other dealer right away. Most importantly, being a new
                                    bike owner, I felt totally confident when I made the purchase that is was the right
                                    bike for me, and I must say that this was ONLY possible by the extreme
                                    professionalism and genuine integrity of your Sales staff, primarily Rocky Aguanno.
                                    What a great guy! Dealing with Rocky just made me feel that I was doing the right
                                    thing without a doubt and Im a picky guy! The way that he looked after the deal from
                                    start to finish answering all my questions and concerns was without a doubt, the
                                    most pleasant buying experience I have ever had. The Sales Manager, Mike Ball was
                                    also extremely helpful and he worked hand in hand with Rocky to solidify the deal.
                                    Today I went on my first long ride with the bike and it performed flawlessly and I
                                    am so happy that Rocky convinced me into buying this bike. He said that he was
                                    confident that I would like the bike and boy was he right. I cant thank him enough.
                                    Please extend my gratitude to Rocky and Mike for me, you have some great people
                                    working for you. I am also spreading the word with my friends on Snow City. I wish
                                    you all the success in the world. Keep on being a great store!</p>
