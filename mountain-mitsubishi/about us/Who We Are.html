                                    We eat, sleep, and breathe Mitsubishi cars. Some of our staff have been working on
                                    Mitsubishi cars for decades. They've seen major model changes, but the reliability
                                    of Mitsubishi models always stays the same. We get to know cars year after year and
                                    we love seeing returning customers visit us again and again.
