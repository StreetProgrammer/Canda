                                    <p>As a valued customer of Mitsubishi Motor Sales of Canada and our dealership, we
                                        want to ensure your ownership experience is a great one - every step of the
                                        way.<br>
                                        How do we do that? We’ve developed a program called MICAR to provide you with
                                        information and tools that help you get the most out of owning and maintaining
                                        Mitsubishi.</p>

                                    <h2 class="bold upper black">THIS IS HOW WE KEEP YOU INFORMED</h2>

                                    <p>We realize that sometimes life can get busy and that maintenance may get
                                        overlooked. Through the MICAR program, your Mitsubishi dealer will notify you
                                        when it’s time to service your vehicle with a letter, email, text message or
                                        phone call. Of course, you can always book an appointment on our online
                                        scheduling page.</p>

                                    <h2 class="bold upper black">THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT</h2>

                                    <p>At every service visit, our advisors will walk you through what you can expect
                                        during the appointment and present you with the factory required maintenance for
                                        your vehicle. Our work begins once you know what maintenance will be performed
                                        and we have your authorization.</p>
