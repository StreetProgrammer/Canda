                                    the vehicle, it automatically reduces engine power and applies brakes independently
                                    on the wheels with less traction. This reduces the chance of understeer or oversteer
                                    in tough cornering situations, enhancing safety and helping your vehicle stay on its
                                    path.

                                    This allows the wheels to continue turning while stopping in an emergency, keeping

                                    Found exclusively on Outlander GT S-AWC, the Active Front Differential limits the
                                    differential speed between the right and left front wheels with an electronically
                                    controlled clutch when oversteer or understeer is detected, helping you hug the
                                    corners as you originally planned.

                                    This highly advanced system uses real-time data from the steering wheel angle, yaw
                                    rate, driving torque, braking pressure and wheel speed to detect excessive
                                    rotational force on any given wheel. It applies ABS systems as required to the four
                                    wheels to quickly manage wheel speed and maximize traction, providing an enhanced,
                                    sporty feel in tight corners, and improved safety when braking or accelerating in
                                    slippery or snow-covered turns.
