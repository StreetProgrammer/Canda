        <strong>SECURITY:</strong></p>
    <p>This web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit
        sensitive information via the web site, their information is protected both online and
        off-line.
    </p>
    <p>When our quote request or order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as
        credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is
        protected with the best encryption software in
        the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the
        bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer
        becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open,
        when you are just "surfing".</p>
    <p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do
        everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users'
        information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above,
        has restricted access at , Turnkey Web Solutions and at the dealership. Only employees
        who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, order clerk, sales
        representative, or a customer service representative)
        are granted access to personally identifiable information. Access to the information is
        made via a password-protected site. Each time an employee needs to access information,
        they must enter their password to gain access
        to the information. Furthermore, employees are kept up-to-date on our security and
        privacy practices. Employees are periodically notified and/or reminded about the
        importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to
        ensure our customers' information is protected.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>SUPPLEMENTATION OF INFORMATION:</strong></p>
    <p>In order for this web site to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it may be
        necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from third
        party sources.<br> For example, to determine if
        customers qualify for financing, the dealership may use their name and social security
        number to request a credit report or approval from a lending institution.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>SITE AND SERVICE UPDATES:</strong></p>
    <p>Turnkey Web Solutions and&nbsp;North Shore Marine Ltd&nbsp;may send the user site and
        service announcement updates which contain important information about the service. We
