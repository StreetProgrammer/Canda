                                <p>As a valued customer of Mitsubishi Motor Sales of Canada and our dealership, we want
                                    to ensure your ownership experience is a great one - every step of the way.<br>
                                    How do we do that? We’ve developed a program called MICAR to provide you with
                                    information and tools that help you get the most out of owning and maintaining
                                    Mitsubishi.</p>

                                <h1 class="bold upper">
                                    THIS IS HOW WE KEEP YOU INFORMED
                                </h1>
                                <p>
                                    We realize that sometimes life can get busy and that maintenance may get overlooked.
                                    Through the MICAR program, your Mitsubishi dealer will notify you when it’s time to
                                    service your vehicle with a letter, email, text message or phone call. Of course,
                                    you can always book an appointment on our online scheduling page.
                                </p>

                                <p>At every service visit, our advisors will walk you through what you can expect during
                                    the appointment and present you with the factory required maintenance for your
                                    vehicle. Our work begins once you know what maintenance will be performed and we
                                    have your authorization.</p>
