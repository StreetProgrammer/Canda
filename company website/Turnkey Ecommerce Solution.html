                <span>Whole Goods</span>
                <p style="line-height: 2;">
                    These are your new and used inventories!  These can be integrated using <a href="#">Turnkey DMS Integration.</a> 
                    We recommend only putting deposit on these items however the option is yours.  
                    A consumer would place a deposit online and they would receive an email notifying them that the specific unit had been reserved for them and they have 24 hours “or whatever is best for your dealership” to contact the dealer and finalize the sale.  
                    The inventory will also be reflected online as having a deposit on it giving the consumer another confirmation that they have reserved it and also showing potential buyers that your inventory is moving and in demand.  Shipping is not an option on whole goods but could always be accommodated by the dealer when you finalize the deal.  By placing deposit only on your whole goods, it also allows you to recommend financing terms, 
                    warranties and accessories the consumer may not have thought of when they put a deposit.
