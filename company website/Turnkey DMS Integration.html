                    Good News!  Your dealership is likely already maintaining your whole goods and parts inventory in one place!  
                    Now this information may not be polished and ready for the world to see but why recreate it?  
                    We can now send this information to Ad Manager in our Content Management portal where you can polish it by adding photo’s, 
                    video and descriptions either on your Computer or through our new Mobile Application on the go!  
                    We’re really making this far too easy! Not enough?  We can send this now to Facebook, Kijiji, 
                    Autotrader or virtually any marketplace you use through <a href="#">Turnkey 3PI Syndication</a>!  Still not enough?  
                    Take deposits on your whole goods and sell your parts and accessories right from your website using the <a href="#">Turnkey Ecommerce Solution</a>!

                    This really depends on the ability of your DMS providers feed process.  
                    We can receive data and send data back to your DMS such as sales and deposits.  
                    We call this a two-way feed and will keep your data the cleanest!  
                    Your DMS provider and our support department would work together to map the data properly and ensure that everything is working the way it should.  
                    <br>
                    We would be happy to consult with you on best practices and your specific requirements! <a href="#">Book a Demo Today</a>!
